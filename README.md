# tkd_calendar

This is a calendar website for Wissel Martial Arts. The goal was to help students prepare for their next test dates and organize visually. Each week drops down to show a weekly overview. Clicking on specific days allows the user to input practice of specific parameters or request to review an item in class. Weekly overviews update to show this information.

Created with HTML, CSS, and JS/jQuery.
